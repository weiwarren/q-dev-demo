# High-Level Architecture

The proposed architecture for the full-stack application will consist of the following components:

## Front-End
- **Next.js**: A React framework for building the user interface, allowing users to upload CSV files, preview data, and submit data to the backend.

## Back-End
- **FastAPI**: A modern, fast (high-performance) Python web framework for building APIs with automatic data validation, serialization, and documentation.
- **Pandas**: A Python library for data manipulation and analysis, used to load and process the CSV data.

## Storage
- **Amazon S3**: An object storage service for storing the uploaded CSV files.

## Data Processing
- **AWS Glue Crawler**: A service that automatically crawls the data stored in S3, infers the schema, and populates the AWS Glue Data Catalog.
- **AWS Glue Data Catalog**: A centralized repository to store metadata about the data stored in S3.
- **Amazon Athena**: A serverless query service that allows running SQL queries on the data stored in S3 using the metadata from the AWS Glue Data Catalog.

## Containerization and Deployment
- **Docker**: A platform for building, deploying, and running applications using containers.
- **Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) with Fargate**: A fully managed container orchestration service that allows running and scaling containerized applications without managing the underlying infrastructure.
- **Terraform**: An infrastructure as code (IaC) tool for provisioning and managing the required AWS resources.

## API-First Design Approach
The application will follow an API-first design approach, where the back-end APIs will be designed and documented first, and the front-end will consume these APIs. This approach promotes modularity, scalability, and reusability of the application components.

## High-Level Workflow
1. The user uploads a CSV file through the Next.js front-end.
2. The Next.js application sends the CSV file to the FastAPI back-end.
3. The FastAPI back-end uses Pandas to load and process the CSV data, and returns a preview to the Next.js front-end.
4. If the user is satisfied with the preview, they submit the data through the Next.js front-end.
5. The FastAPI back-end saves the CSV file to Amazon S3.
6. The AWS Glue Crawler detects the new file in S3 and updates the AWS Glue Data Catalog with the schema information.
7. The user can query the data stored in S3 using Amazon Athena, which leverages the metadata from the AWS Glue Data Catalog.

# Deployment and Infrastructure Management
- The application components (Next.js front-end, FastAPI back-end) will be containerized using Docker.
- The containerized applications will be deployed to Amazon ECS with Fargate, which will handle scaling and orchestration.
- Terraform will be used to provision and manage the required AWS resources, such as S3 buckets, ECS clusters, and IAM roles.

# Next Steps
- Define the API contracts for the FastAPI back-end using OpenAPI or Swagger.
- Implement the Next.js front-end components for file upload, data preview, and submission.
- Develop the FastAPI back-end logic for handling file uploads, data processing with Pandas, and saving to S3.
- Set up the AWS Glue Crawler and configure it to detect new files in the S3 bucket.
- Write Terraform configurations to provision the required AWS resources.
- Build and push the Docker images for the Next.js front-end and FastAPI back-end.
- Deploy the containerized applications to Amazon ECS with Fargate using Terraform.
- Test the end-to-end workflow and make necessary adjustments.
