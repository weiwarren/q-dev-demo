# Tips and tricks
- Generate the plan (analysis) => generate the architecture (design) => generate the api (documentations) => generate folder and files (boilerplate) => generate skeleton code => inline completion => generate unit tests => generate deployment code => generate e2e / integration tests for benchmarking
- Separate ideation from code generation
- Generate skeleton with comments using chat, use inline suggestions later on
- Use it to create test case scenarios for the code instead of generating valid test cases at once
- Provide example of test case including mock and dependencies instead of let it magically figure out all the mocks required in the function chain.
- Use Cmd+C to force generation if you are not getting anything or send it to chat directly
- Insert comments if you are not getting inline suggestions.
- Escape all the triple ticks, all the hash and empty line break to remove automatic styling in chat

# Problem Statement
- [ ] A simple data lake platform to upload CSV, preview a subset of data / (maybe transform), then trigger glue to crawl so I can query using athena from the app.
- [ ] Iterative fast locally and can be deployed to prod easily
